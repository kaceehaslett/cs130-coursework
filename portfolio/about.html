  <p>
    Hello! My name is Kacee Haslett.
 
    I currently am a sophomore at Northwestern University studying Journalism, Integrated Marketing Communications, and Creative Writing.
    ​
    I have always loved to write and to design. Ever since I was a kid, I was telling stories. There is a copy in my room of the first story I wrote (titled: The Worst Flowing River Ever!) and I have pink flash drives full of half-finished “chapter books” with fleshed out universes and characters.
    ​
    I discovered an additional love of social media and design in high school when I served on my high school’s newsmagazine/website staff.
    ​
    This is a collection of some of the work I have done, and linked here is a database of the courses I have taken and finished.
