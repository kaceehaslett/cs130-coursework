  <h2>trojan matters</h2>
  <p>
    While I attended Bishop Chatard, I was a member of the publications team. The newly-minted newsmagazine staff was comprised of students who completed the journalism prerequisites and 
    additionally showed promise in their applications. It is not typical for students to be admitted to the program as sophomores, but my stand-out reporting and design skills allowed for admission.
     
    During the school year, the team met four times a week during class and published a 24-page magazine monthly. This first year, I was a general reporter, and typically reported and designed one-to-two spreads each month. 
     
    Here, I have showcased each published spread I designed, and each photo links to a copy of that month's issue as well, so the piece(s) that I reported on can also be found.
